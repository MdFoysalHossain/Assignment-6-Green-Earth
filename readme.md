1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Var was used do declare variable before let was added. Let is mostly used instead of var as a global variable, it can be edited, changed or updated. But Const is fixed. After adding the first value it can not be changed or updated.


2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
forEach() is used to execute function for each of the item it gets. It gets a array and creates a new array separate from the first one.

3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
arrow function is a shorter form of normal function used in Es6.

4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
With destructuring we can set name variable in the declaration of the variable. It helps to identify and get value easily.


5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
With the help of template literals we can create dynamic string easily instead of concatting and making it less painful. Main defference is that we can use other variable values with template literals without concating them togather.
